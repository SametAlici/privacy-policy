# Privacy Policy for CleanSwipe

Last updated: February 02, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how CleanSwipe ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). This policy applies to both the Android and iOS versions of the App.

## 1. Information We Collect
A. Photo and Video Data (Local Processing)  
To function as a gallery cleaner, the App requires access to your device's photo library.

- We do NOT upload your photos or videos to any external server.  
- All analysis, sorting, and organization of your media happen locally on your device.  
- The App only deletes photos or videos when you explicitly confirm the action via the trash/delete functionality.

B. Usage Data & Analytics  
We use third-party services like Firebase Analytics and Google Analytics to understand how our App is used. This data is anonymous and does not personally identify you. It may include:

- Device model and operating system version.  
- App usage times and frequency.  
- Standard crash logs to help us fix bugs.

C. Advertising Data  
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use:

- Device Identifiers: Such as the Advertising ID (IDFA on iOS, AAID on Android) to show personalized ads.  
- Location Data: Approximate location data derived from IP addresses to show relevant ads.  
- Cookies and similar technologies: To measure ad performance and deliver ads.

Since we request permission to track (via iOS App Tracking Transparency), if you grant permission, this data helps deliver ads that are more relevant to you. If you decline, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant.

## 2. Permissions We Request
To provide the App's core features, we request the following permissions and explain their purpose per platform:

- Photo Library Access (iOS):  
  - The App requests access to your Photos so it can read media to analyze, group and present suggestions for deletion or organization. On iOS you may be presented with options such as allowing access to the selected photos only, the entire library, or “Add Only” for saving. The App will request the minimum needed access to perform its functions.  
  - To delete media, the App uses the device’s photo APIs and will only remove items after your explicit confirmation.

- Photo/Media Storage Access (Android):  
  - On Android, the App requests access to read media files in order to analyze and present them for cleaning (e.g., `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` on Android 13+, or scoped storage APIs on newer Android versions). If write/delete is required, the App will request the appropriate permission or use the system UI (MediaStore/Storage Access Framework) to perform deletions with your consent.
  - For older Android versions, legacy permissions such as `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` / `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` may be used where applicable, but the App prefers the platform's scoped storage and recommended practices.

- Tracking / Advertising ID:  
  - iOS: We may prompt the App Tracking Transparency permission (ATT). If you allow tracking, the App and AdMob may use your IDFA for personalized ads. If you deny, personalized ad targeting via IDFA will be limited.  
  - Android: Ad networks may use the Google Advertising ID (AAID). Users can reset or opt out of interest-based ads in Android settings.

Note: The App will always ask for permissions at runtime and will not perform actions (like deleting) without your explicit confirmation.

## 3. Third-Party Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

- To facilitate our Service;  
- To provide the Service on our behalf;  
- To perform Service-related services; or  
- To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties may have access to certain data to perform their functions but are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

Third-party services used by the App include (links lead to their privacy documentation):
- Google AdMob — advertising services  
- Firebase Analytics — analytics and crash reporting  
(Please review each provider’s privacy policy for full details.)

## 4. In-App Purchases
The App may offer premium features via In-App Purchases.

- Transactions are processed securely by Apple App Store or Google Play Store.  
- We do not collect or store your billing information (such as credit card numbers).

## 5. Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Since your personal media files (photos/videos) remain on your device and are not transmitted to us, the risk to your personal content is minimized.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
